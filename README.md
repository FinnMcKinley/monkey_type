Monkey Type!

This is an incredibly quick project made to see how long it would take to write out any file using random 'button mashing'.
Simply run main.py, and type in whatever file you want to run when prompted. I have already got 3 examples loaded:
example.txt
shakespare.txt
big.txt
The last two take a long time to run, and no status updates are posted until the program is complete so don't panic if nothing happens for a while


I have been interested in the infinite monkey theory for a very long time and although I know there are 1000s of similar programs,
I just wanted to see if I can make it myself as I am only learning to code in python. 

While your here check out some of my other projects! Im always looking for inspiration, ideas and advice so if you have any let me know!

This project uses the shakespare.txt as an example which was created by Blake Sanie:

This big.txt file:

And finally example.txt from:
